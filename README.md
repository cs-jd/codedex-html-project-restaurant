# Ramen Ichiraku Restaurant

Restaurant menu made as the final project for Codédex's HTML course.


## About the project

This is an HTML project, even though it has way more CSS than anything else. I know the CSS isn't perfect, but my priority was to make this work well as I intended. I actually had to learn a couple more things along the way just to be able to wexecute (most of) my ideas.

I'm very thankful to the Codédex community for being so helpful and keeping me accountable. I've done a lot of progress in the two days I dedicated to this project - way more than I thought to be possible.

I intend to come back to this in the future and try to fix the not-so-ideal parts of the CSS. For now, I'm happy I liked the end result and will continue learning so I can always surpass my own expectations.
